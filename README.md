# Drops In The Bucket
## Synopsis
A tool for gathering sounds from a distance, and stirring them together. 

## How it works
This app provides a specific workflow for collaboration between sound artists, improvisatory musicians, field recordists, etc. Users create 'rooms' and invite other users to join. All members of a room are expected to contribute an audio recording through the app's recorder interface. That recording should follow a set of instructions or rules specified by the room's creator. When all members have contributed, the server dubs the recordings over one another and shares the composite with the group. At this point members can redo their recording if they wish. Once all members are happy with their submission, the room is closed and the composited recording may be downloaded.

Users can make accounts to keep track of active and closed rooms.
