# Drops In The Bucket
## Synopsis
A tool for gathering sounds from a distance, and stirring them together. 

## How it works
This app provides a specific workflow for long-distance collaboration between sound artists, improvisatory musicians, field recordists, etc. To begin, a user creates a 'room' and invites other users to join. All members of a room are expected to contribute an audio recording through the app's recorder interface. That recording should follow a set of instructions or rules specified by the room's creator. These recordings are 'drops' in the 'bucket.' When all members have contributed - i.e. once the bucket is full - the server dubs the recordings over one another and shares the composite with the group. At this point members are allowed to replace their recording with a new one. Once all members are happy with their submission, the room is closed and the composite recording may be downloaded.

Users can make accounts to keep track of active and closed rooms.
