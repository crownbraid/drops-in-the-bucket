# Drops In The Bucket: *a tool for gathering sounds from a distance, and stirring them together.*

## Purpose
To implement a game-like workflow in long-distance collaboration between sound artists, improvisatory musicians, field recordists, etc. 

## How it works
Users may browse, create, or join rooms. Within a room, members contribute audio recordings - through the app's recorder interface -
which should follow performance instructions specified by the room's host. These recordings are 'drops' in the 'bucket.' Once the bucket is full, the server 'stirs' the recordings together; it dubs them over one another and shares the composite with the group. Recordings may be substituted at any time. The composite recording may then be downloaded, or users may supplant their submission with a new one.
