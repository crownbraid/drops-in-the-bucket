# Drops In The Bucket: *a tool for gathering sounds from a distance, and stirring them together.*

## Purpose
To implement a game-like workflow for long-distance collaboration between sound artists, improvisatory musicians, field recordists, etc. 

## How it works
Users may browse, create, or join rooms. Within a room, members contribute audio recordings - through the app's recorder interface -
which should consider performance instructions specified by the room's host. These recordings are 'drops' in the 'bucket.' Once the bucket is full, the server 'stirs' the recordings together; it dubs them over one another and shares the composite with the group. The composite recording may be downloaded, or users may supplant their submission with a new one.
