# Drops In The Bucket: #### *a tool for gathering sounds from a distance, and stirring them together.*

## Synopsis
This app provides a specific, game-like workflow for long-distance collaboration between sound artists, improvisatory musicians, field recordists, etc. 

## How it works
A user creates a 'room' and invites other users to join. Each member of a room contributes an audio recording through the app's recorder interface. To guide these recordings, the room's creator may specify a set of instructions or rules.

These recordings are 'drops' in the 'bucket.' Once the bucket is full - i.e. when all members have contributed - the server dubs the recordings over one another and shares the composite with the group. Members are then provided the opportunity to replace their recording with a new one. Once all members are happy with their submission, the room is closed and the composite recording may be downloaded.

Upon login, a user may browse all rooms they've registered in.
